# Simple Flask App

In this project, we implemented the address 'api/v1/hello-world-{variant}' with an HTTP response status code of 200. To do this, we used the Python 3.6 virtual environment and the requirements.txt dependency control system.

## Requirements

 - [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
 - [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

## Project deployment
To download this project to your computer and then use it, use the git clone command.
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:AnastasiiaDunas/PP3.git
```
After that, we need to navigate to the project directory in cmd or PowerShell.
```bash
  cd ...\...\...\venv
```
We need to activate the virtual environment.
```bash
  Scripts\activate
```
Then we can install our requirements.
```bash
  cd..
```
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now we can safely launch our project.
```bash
  python venv\script.py
```
## Example
Then we can simply go to the following address:
```bash
  http://localhost:5000/api/v1/hello-world-10
```
